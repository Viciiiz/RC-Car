        Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB and follow these steps:<br>
        <br>&emsp;1. Make sure your board is seen by the IDE. Go to Tools > Board > "Arduino Mega or Mega 2560".
        <br>&emsp;2. Verify if the IDE is communicating to the right port. Go to Tools > Port > connect to the port that is available. If there are multiple ports, go to Device Manager > Ports to verify which port is connected to your board.
        <br>&emsp;3. At the top of the IDE, click on the arrow button to upload the code to your arduino Mega 2560.
